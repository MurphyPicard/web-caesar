## Hello my millions of fans.

This is a fully functioning app I made to practice using forms via python.

The user can input a number and a message at the welcome page.
The user can see his/her message encrypted, with each alpha character
    rotated by the number specified.
To play again, the user can then either choose a new number or message or both.

All the code is in - main.py - and the helper functions I used are in caesar.py.
I created the helper functions a few weeks ago for a LaunchCode assignment.

One of the things I'm working on these days is using different files for
separation of concerns and for keeping my code DRY.  As I practice python using
google app engine for my LaunchCode class, I'm noticing the simiilarities with
Ruby on Rails and with the MEANstack, and getting a better understanding of GET,
POST, requests and responses and how to use them in Python.
